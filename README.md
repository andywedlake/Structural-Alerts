Open the workflow in KNIME

Orange annotations boxes with black outlines are next to the input files. You'll need to right click on the Readers and configure them to give location of training set and test set.

"Automated Workflow Parameters" can be changed in configuration of the "Table Creator" on the left of the workflow.

Red annotations boxes with black outlines are next to output files. Configure these and choose a location for output files.

White annotations boxes describe what the nodes are doing.


If the KNIME workflow is missing nodes, you may need to install the Nightly Builds from the KNIME community contributions https://www.knime.com/community .
